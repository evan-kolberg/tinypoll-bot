So, you know the drill. Download the repo, install the libs, edit some vars, and see if it works. It's no different in this project. 

There are two python files, the bot.py and the repeater.py. The bot.py is the file that you will edit. Replace the link var and title var.
The repeater.py file is what you will actually be running. All you need to do is run that file after you edited the bot.py, put in the
number of bots you want when it prompts, and have fun. Then, sit back and watch your friends question if they are actually being hacked
(play along of course).



As always, have fun!
